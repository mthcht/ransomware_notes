>>>>> What is the guarantee that we won't scam you?
We are the oldest extortion gang on the planet and nothing is more important to us than our reputation. We are not a politically motivated group and want nothing but financial rewards for our work. If we defraud even one client, other clients will not pay us. In 5 years, not a single client has been left dissatisfied after making a deal with us. If you pay the ransom, we will fulfill all the terms we agreed upon during the negotiation process. Treat this situation simply as a paid training session for your system administrators, because it was the misconfiguration of your corporate network that allowed us to attack you. Our pentesting services should be paid for the same way you pay your system administrators' salaries. You can get more information about us on wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LockBit
