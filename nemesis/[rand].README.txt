		Your systems are encrypted and sensitive data has been stolen.
		Do not shut down your systems or attempt to use any other recovery programs - files may be corrupted or lost.
		[+][+][+]
		ONLY OUR decryptor can get your files back.
		To make sure we REALLY CAN get your files back, we give you the opportunity to decrypt multiple files for free during the negotiation process.

		We are not a politically motivated group - we are only interested in money.

		We do not advise you to contact the police. They will not get your files back or prevent your data from being leaked - they will simply prevent you and us from negotiating.
		We do not advise you to contact recovery companies. They will not get your files back or prevent your data from being leaked - they will simply buy the decryptor from us and resell it to you at their markup.

		YOU MUST UNDERSTAND:
		If you do not make contact and comply by the specified deadline, all stolen data - 
		including customer KYC documents, personal and financial information of customers and employees (including a list of the largest holders of 
		deposits), as well as the bank's confidential financial documents, transaction details and other sensitive information - will be sold 
		to third parties or published in the public domain.
