🔒 URGENT: YOUR SYSTEMS ARE COMPROMISED

We've extracted 200 GB of your most sensitive data, encrypted your servers and workstations, and removed backups. 
Your critical information—financials, employee records, client contracts, and internal documents—is now under our control, cataloged, and ready for release.
We understand the impact this has on your business. Let's resolve this discreetly and turn it into a chance to strengthen your defenses.

🧨 What Happens If You Ignore Us:

Time 			Action

24 hours 	Key data shared with competitors
48 hours 	Clients notified with proof of their leaked data
72 hours 	Media and bloggers receive leak fragments
96 hours 	Full archive published on darknet


Once the process starts, it’s unstoppable. Your data will spread uncontrollably, risking fraud, extortion, and reputational ruin. 
Sensitive personal content from devices is also in our possession—we’d prefer to keep it private.

⚠️ A Warning Before Involving Others:Insurance firms, consultants, or authorities will prioritize their own agendas—delays, mandatory disclosures, and legal complications will follow. 
We've seen this lead to public exposure every time. Keep this internal for the best outcome.

Immediate decryption of your systems  
Secure deletion of all extracted data (with video proof and hashes)  
Detailed report on how we accessed your systems and how to fix vulnerabilities
