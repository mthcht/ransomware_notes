Before encryption, we downloaded your confidential data . If you refuse to pay or do not contact us, this 
data will be published on our Tor blog for your competitors and regulators to see.

HOW TO GET YOUR FILES BACK?

You must purchase a unique decryption tool from us.

We have analyzed your files If you do not pay:
1. We will send copies of this incriminating data directly to your GOVERNMENT 
   agencies and regulators to trigger an investigation against you.
