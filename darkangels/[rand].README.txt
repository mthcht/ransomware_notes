The best and only thing you can do is to contact us
to settle the matter before any losses occurs.

1. THE FOLLOWING IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN

1.1 EDITING FILES ON HDD.
Renaming, copying or moving any files
could DAMAGE the cipher and
decryption will be impossible.

1.2 USING THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE.
Trying to recover with any software
can also break the cipher and
file recovery will become a problem.

1.3 SHUTDOWN OR RESTART THE PC.
Boot and recovery errors can also damage the cipher.
Sorry about that, but doing so is entirely at your own risk.




 2. TO DO LIST (best practies)
- Contact us as soon as possible.
- Contact us only in our live chat, otherwise you can run into scammers.
- Purchase our decryption tool and decrypt your files. There is no other way to do this.
- Realize that dealing with us is the shortest way to success and secrecy.
- Give up the idea of using decryption help programs, otherwise you will destroy the system permanently.
