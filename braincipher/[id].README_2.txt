ATTENTION: YOUR DATA HAS BEEN LOCKED!

Dear representatives of the company,

We are compelled to inform you that your information system has been successfully breached by our group. 
All your data, including financial reports, customer databases, internal documentation, correspondence, and even backup files, have been encrypted using state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms.
Without our unique decryption key, restoring access to this data is impossible.
We strongly advise against attempting to resolve this issue independently, as any such attempts may result in irreversible data loss.

Your company is now in an extremely vulnerable position. Disclosure or destruction of the data may lead to serious consequences, including:

Financial losses: 

Leakage of confidential information can result in lawsuits, fines, and compensation claims. 
Moreover, your competitors may exploit this data to gain an unfair advantage in the market.

Reputational damage:

Loss of trust from clients and partners may negatively impact your business. 
News of the cyberattack will spread quickly, and your brand may become associated with unreliability and an inability to protect data.

Legal consequences: 

Violation of data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, or other regional regulations) may lead to significant fines and audits by regulatory authorities.
This may also necessitate a mandatory restructuring of your data processing procedures.

Operational issues: 

Lack of access to critical systems may lead to a complete halt in your company’s operations.
This could affect not only you but also your customers, partners, and suppliers.


ADDITIONAL RISKS AND THREATS:

Legal consequences for company leadership:

If we decide to disclose the data, it may lead to criminal charges against your company’s management for negligence and violation of data protection rules. 
You personally may be held accountable, and your career could be at risk.

Media and public opinion:

We collaborate with various media outlets and are ready to provide them with part of your data for public exposure. 
Information about your inability to protect data will become public knowledge, leading to further reputational damage.

Mass lawsuits from clients and partners:

We have prepared anonymous instructions for your clients and partners affected by the leak.
These instructions will help them file class-action lawsuits against your company.
We understand the importance of the stolen information for your organization. 
Currently, all data is in our possession. 
We are ready to discuss the terms of transferring the decryption key and guarantee the complete deletion of all copied data after receiving payment. 

We also offer an alternative: ignoring this message will either lead to the public leakage of data through our special portal on the Dark Web or result in its complete destruction.

PLEASE NOTE: Any contact with law enforcement agencies or data recovery companies will be considered a violation of our agreement.

If we discover that you are collaborating with third parties, this will immediately lead to the following actions:

Key deletion: all decryption keys will be irrevocably deleted.
Public leak: We will release part of the data on public resources to ensure maximum reputational damage.
Increased recovery cost: The price for decryption will double, and the timeframe for providing the key will be extended.
Legal consequences for leadership: We will pass information about your collaboration with law enforcement to the media and regulatory bodies, leading to additional legal and reputational problems.


We understand that this is a difficult situation and would like to offer you a way to resolve it. For this purpose, we provide clear instructions for data recovery. 
Please note that time is limited. If we do not receive a response within 72 hours, the cost of recovery will increase, and the likelihood of data preservation will significantly decrease.
