Good day! Your company has failed a simple penetration test.

>> Your network has been completely encrypted by our software.

Our ransomware virus uses advanced cryptography technology that will make it very difficult for you to recover your information.

>> All information has been stolen.
We have stolen all information from all devices on your network, including NAS. The data includes but is not limited to: employee passport details, internal documentation, financial documents, and so on.

>> You have about 240 hours to respond.
If there is no response, all stolen information will be distributed.
We are waiting for you to decide to write to us, and we will be happy to negotiate a ransom price with you. By paying the ransom, you will also receive:
1) a report on how we infiltrated your network
2) instructions + software that decrypts all files
3) our assistance in recovery, if needed.

>> They will not help you; they are your enemies.
Recovery agencies, the police, and other services will NOT HELP you. Agencies want your money, but they do not know how to negotiate. 

If you think you can restore your infrastructure from external backups that we did not access, we warn you:
1) The laws of any country impose huge fines on companies for information leaks.
2) Playing against us will not work in your favor. We will gladly wipe every one of your servers and computers.

When you write to us, we expect to hear from you who you are and what your relationship to the company is.
